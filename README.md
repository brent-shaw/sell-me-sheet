# sell-me-sheet
Quick and easy in store catalogue using spreadsheet based price-lists, and Zapper for payment.

**NOTE:** This is not intended as an online store, but as an in-store catalogue and alternative to cash and card based payments.

## Usage
Using sell-me-sheet is simple, you just fill out the spreadsheet with the items you would like, and place any images you would like to use in the image folder. When the site is started, the shop will be built based on this information.

The shop will then be accessible and usable. The whole shop is dynamic and will add row, column and specials banners as needed. The categories menu, shop name and pricing is also dynamic, and only needs to be set in the spreadsheet.

If you enter your company's Zapper information is entered into the spreadsheet, then Zapper codes will automatically be created and embedded on each page.
